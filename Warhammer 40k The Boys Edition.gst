The target unit gains the Precision Strikes (6+) and Precision Shots (6+) special rules for the duration of the current player turn. When using this power, the controlling player may choose to have the Psyker take a Psychic check. If the Check is passed then the target unit instead gains the Precision Strikes (5+) and Precision Shots (5+) special rules for the duration of the current player turn. If the Check is failed then no additional benefit is gained and the Psyker suffers Perils of the Warp.

    <rule id="5de7-dbec-8706-f21a" name="Deep Strike" publicationId="3ff9-2058-b559-545b" page="162" hidden="false">
      <description>In order for a unit to be able to Deep Strike, all models in the unit must have the Deep Strike special rule and the unit must start the game in Reserve (see page 147). When placing the unit in Reserve, you must tell your opponent that it will be arriving by Deep Strike (sometimes called Deep Strike Reserve). Some units must arrive by Deep Strike. They always begin the game in Reserve and always arrive by Deep Strike.


Arriving by Deep Strike
Roll for the arrival of all Deep Striking units as specified in the rules for Reserves (see page 147) and then deploy them as follows:
First, place one model from the unit anywhere on the table,in the position where you would like it to arrive, and roll for scatter to determine the model’s final position. If a vehicle scatters when arriving via Deep Strike, do not change its facing – it must continue to face the same direction as it did before you rolled for scatter. Next, the unit’s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the first model and begin to form a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further concentric circle must be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle must include as many models as will fit. Models deploying via Deep Strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain.
In the Movement phase during which they arrive, Deep Striking units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a Deep Striking Transport vehicle if they are in one. Units Deep Striking into ruins are placed on the ground floor. Deep Striking units count non-ruined buildings (except for their battlements) as impassable terrain.
In that turn’s Shooting phase, these units can fire (or Run, Turbo-boost or move Flat Out) as normal, and count as having moved in the previous Movement phase. Vehicles, except for Walkers, count as having moved at Combat Speed (even Immobilised vehicles). This can affect the number of weapons they can fire with their full Ballistic Skill (see page 71).
In that turn’s Assault phase, however, these units cannot charge. This also applies to units that have disembarked from Transports that arrived by Deep Strike that turn.


Deep Strike and Transports
Units do not confer the Deep Strike special rule onto a Transport vehicle they are embarked inside. A Transport vehicle with Deep Strike may Deep Strike regardless of whether its passengers have Deep Strike or not.


Flyers and Deep Strike
As well as arriving via the usual Reserves method, some Flyers also have the ability to deploy via Deep Strike, representing a vertical ‘dive’ onto the battlefield. If the Flyer in question has the Hover mode special rule, the controlling player must declare before the Deep Strike is attempted whether the Flyer is Zooming or being treated as a Fast Skimmer. If using Hover Mode, the rules for Deep Strike apply as standard. If using a Zooming Deep Strike, Flyers deployed via Deep Strike count as making a Zoom move and having moved at Cruising Speed (18&quot;) on the turn they arrive, but are not moved any further in the turn in which they are deployed. They cannot evade, go Flat Out, drop bombs or deploy transported units in the turn in which they arrive. On subsequent turns, the Flyer is free to operate as normal. This is a risky proposition for an aircraft and a test of the pilot’s skill, and so the usual rules for Deep Strike Mishaps apply even though the Flyer is notionally at a higher altitude than is normally the case for models subject to the Deep Strike Mishaps rules.


Deep Strike Mishaps
Deep Striking onto a crowded battlefield can be dangerous, as one may miss the intended objective or even materialise inside
solid rock. If any of the models in a Deep Striking unit cannot be deployed, because at least one model would land partially or fully off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top of or within 1&quot; of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the Deep Strike Mishap table and apply the results. If the unfortunate unit is also a Transport, the Deep Strike Mishap result applies to both the unit and anything embarked within it.


DEEPSTRIKE MISHAP TABLE
D6 Effect
1 Terrible Accident! Teleporting units are lost in the Warp, deep striking jump units are shot down, or some other suitably
dramatic event occurs.
The entire unit is destroyed!


2-3 Misplaced. The coordinates were inaccurate or the enemy has jammed your instruments.
Your opponent may deploy the unit anywhere on the table (excluding impassable terrain, but including difficult terrain, which of
course counts as dangerous terrain for Deep Striking units) in a valid Deep Strike formation, but without rolling for scatter. Units embarked on a misplaced Transport can disembark during their Movement phase as normal.


4-6 Delayed. Because of mechanical failure or enemy action, the reinforcements are delayed.
The unit is placed in Ongoing Reserves (see page 147).</description>

cannot make a Look Out, Sir attempt to avoid a wound caused by the Gets Hot special rule. A vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 to hit. On a roll of a 1, 2 or 3, it suffers a glancing hit.


Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot
is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single wound (armour saves or invulnerable saves can be taken) – this wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit. A character cannot make a Look Out, Sir attempt to avoid a wound caused by the Gets Hot special rule. A vehicle instead suffers a glancing hit on a further roll of a 1, 2 or 3.


Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

      <description>When a model with this special rule suffers an unsaved wound, it can make a special Feel No Pain roll to avoid being wounded (this
is not a saving throw and so can be used against attacks that state that ‘no saves of any kind are allowed’, for example, those inflicted by Perils of the Warp). Feel No Pain rolls may not be taken against Destroyer attacks (see page 163) or against unsaved wounds that have the Instant Death special rule.
Roll a D6 each time an unsaved wound is suffered. On a 4 or less, you must take the wound as normal. On a 5+, the unsaved wound is discounted – treat it as having been saved. If a unit has the Feel No Pain special rule with a number in brackets afterwards – Feel No Pain (6+), for example – then the number in brackets is the D6 result needed to discount the wound. A model’s Feel No Pain roll can never be improved beyond 2+.</description>

A model striking a Hated foe in close combat re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls during the first round of each close combat.

The effects of this special rule only apply when a unit that has it begins an Assault phase not locked in combat and then either Charges or is Charged by an enemy unit.

Units that Infiltrate in this way can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9&quot; from any enemy unit, as long as no deployed enemy unit can draw line of sight to them.

Alternatively, they can be set up anywhere on the battlefield more than 12&quot; from any enemy unit, even in plain sight.If a unit with Infiltrate deploys inside a Dedicated Transport, the same rules apply when deploying their Transport.

A unit that deploys using these rules cannot Charge in their first turn.Having Infiltrate also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Infiltrators that are kept as Reserves (see page 309).

      <description>After both sides have deployed (including Infiltrators), but before the first player begins their first turn, a unit containing at least one model with this special rule can choose to redeploy. If the unit is Infantry, Artillery, Dreadnought or Automata, each model can redeploy anywhere entirely within 6&quot; of its current position. If it is any other Unit Type, each model can instead redeploy anywhere entirely within 12&quot; of its current position. During this redeployment, Scouts can move outside the owning player’s Deployment Zone, but must remain more than 9&quot; away from any enemy unit. A unit that makes a Scout redeployment cannot Charge in the first Game Turn. A unit cannot Embark or Disembark as part of a Scout redeployment.


If both sides have Scouts, roll off; the winner decides who redeploys first. Then alternate redeploying Scout units one at a time. If a unit with this special rule is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, it confers the Scout special rule to the Transport (though a Disembarkation cannot be performed as part of the redeployment). Note that a Transport with this special rule does not lose it if a unit without this special rule is Embarked upon it.

      <description>All Barrage weapons use Blast markers and consequently use the rules for Blast weapons, as indicated by their profile, with the following exceptions:
Barrage weapons can fire indirectly. This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their Minimum Range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker always scatters a full 2D6&quot;. If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its Minimum Range.
Note that any Hits inflicted upon Vehicles by an Attack using the Barrage special rule are always resolved against the Vehicle’s Side Armour Value.

Multiple Barrages
If a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:
The Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the Blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier. Once the first marker is placed, roll a Scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram below). If a Hit is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker). Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of Hits and roll To Wound for these Hits. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first Blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage.

Apocalyptic Barrage
An Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clover-shaped Apocalyptic Barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it. 

Once the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon’s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type ‘Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage’, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a ‘strike’ on one of the circles on the Apocalyptic Barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire Apocalyptic Barrage marker.</description>

If the result is equal to or more than the value listed in brackets as part of this rule then one of the following options may be applied to any one Vehicle, Dreadnought or Automata the model is in base contact with or Embarked upon:

      <description>To resolve a Destroyer weapon’s attack, roll To Hit as you would for a standard attack. If the attack hits, roll on the table below instead of rolling To Wound or for armour penetration.
Most Destroyer weapons have AP 1 or AP 2, so armour saves are not typically allowed. cover saves and invulnerable saves can be taken against hits from a Destroyer weapon as normal, unless a Devastating Hit or Deathblow result is rolled.
For the purposes of determining if a Destroyer hit has the Instant Death special rule, assume it has Strength 10. Multiple wounds/Hull points inflicted by a Destroyer hit do not carry over to other models in the unit (any excess are lost).


VEHICLE OR BUILDING TABLE
1: Lucky Escape: The Model is unharmed.
2-5: Solid Hit: The model suffers a penetrating hit that causes it to lose D3 Hull points instead of 1. 
6: Devestating Hit: The model suffers a penetrating hit that causes it to lose D6+6 Hull points instead of 1. No saves of any kind are allowed against this hit.


NON-VEHICLE TABLE
1: Lucky Escape: The model is unharmed.
2-5: Seriously Wounded: The model suffers a hit that wounds automatically and causes it to lose D3 Wounds instead of 1. 
Deathblow: The model suffers a hit that wounds automatically and causes D6+6 wounds instead of 1. No saves of any kind are allowed against this hit.</description>

For example, a weapon with the Exoshock (4+) special rule would inflict a second Penetrating Hit on the score of a 4+. This second Penetrating Hit does not gain the effects of any other special rules, and cannot trigger additional Hits.

MOVEMENT
Cavalry can move up to 12&quot; in the Movement phase. Cavalry are not slowed down by difficult terrain (even when charging). However, Cavalry models treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain instead.
FALL BACK MOVES
Cavalry make Fall Back moves just like Infantry, except that they move 3D6&quot;.

      <description>A model making attacks as part of an Assault using a weapon with this special rule, adds the value of (X) that is included as part of this special rule to its Initiative Characteristic. If a model has more than one weapon with this special rule then that model only increases the value of its Initiative by the value of the special rule on the weapon whose profile is used by that model to attack during the Fight Sub-phase. A weapon that is not used to attack does not modify the model’s Initiative Characteristic – models that may attack with more than one weapon, or models claiming the bonus for having a second weapon, may only add the value of the highest variant of this special rule and do not add the values together.

For example, a model attacking as part of an Assault with a weapon that has the Reach (1) special rule increases its Initiative by +1.</description>

      <description>If a non-vehicle unit suffers one or more unsaved wounds from a weapon with the Pinning special rule, it must take a Leadership test once the firing unit has finished its shooting attacks for that phase. This is called a Pinning test. If the unit fails the test, it is Pinned and must immediately Go to Ground (see page 41). As the unit has already taken its saves, Going to Ground does not protect it against the fire of the Pinning weapon that caused the test. As long as the test is passed, a unit can be called upon to take multiple Pinning tests in a single turn, but only once for each unit shooting at them. If a unit has already Gone to Ground, no further Pinning tests are taken. If the special rules of a unit specify that the unit can never be Pinned, the unit automatically passes Pinning tests. Such units can still Go to Ground voluntarily if they wish.</description>

• Models with the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type count as ten models for the purposes of determining if the model is outnumbered by another unit.
• Models with the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type may only make Reactions triggered by models with the Armiger, Dreadnought, Primarch or Vehicle Unit Type, or any model with a Wounds Characteristic of 8 or more.
• Successful Wounds scored by attacks with the Poisoned or Fleshbane special rules must be re-rolled against models with the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type.
• A model with the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type may attack with all weapons they have in each Shooting Attack they make, including as part of a Reaction.
• A model with the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type may make Shooting Attacks with Heavy and Ordnance weapons, counts as Stationary even if it moved in the preceding Movement phase, and may declare Charges as normal regardless of any Shooting Attacks made in the same turn.
• No model that does not have the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type may join a unit that includes a model with the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type.
• A model with the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type ignores all effects (both detrimental and beneficial) of all Psychic Powers and cannot be Wounded or affected by any Attack with the Psychic Focus special rule. Weapons with the Force special rule that are used to make Attacks against a model with the Gargantuan Unit Sub-type are not affected and are resolved normally.</description>

A character that has a Precision Shot wound allocated to it can still make a Look Out, Sir roll. Note that Snap Shots can never be Precision Shots.


If a weapon has the Sniper special rule, or is fired by a model with the Sniper special rule, its shooting attacks always wound on at least a To Wound roll of 4+, regardless of the victim’s Toughness. In addition, any To Wound roll of a 6 is resolved at AP 2.</description>

This rule is often presented as Stealth (X) where X indicates a specific type of terrain, such as Stealth (Woods) or Stealth (Ruins).

      <description>A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule that is locked in combat can choose to leave close combat at the end of any Assault phase. If the unit wishes to do so, it must take an Initiative test. If the test is failed, nothing happens and the models remain locked in the fight. If the test is passed, choose a direction – then roll 3D6. As long as the distance rolled, in inches, is sufficient to allow the entire unit to move over 1&quot; away from all of the enemy units they are locked in combat
with, the unit breaks away from combat and must immediately move a number of inches in the chosen direction equal to the 3D6 result, ignoring the models they were locked in combat with. No Sweeping Advance rolls are made. Enemy units that are no longer locked in combat immediately Consolidate D6&quot;. A Hit &amp; Run move is not slowed by difficult terrain, but take  Dangerous Terrain tests as normal. It may not be used to move into base or hull contact with enemy units, and models instead stop 1&quot; away. If there are units with this rule on both sides who wish to disengage, roll-off to determine who goes first and then alternate disengaging them.

Instead, the controlling player gains access to the Combat Air Patrol Advanced Reaction: 

Advanced Reaction: Combat Air Patrol Advanced Reactions are available to specific players as

    <rule name="Flanking Assault" id="f3a9-9b67-4ea2-dd90" hidden="false">
      <description>Flanking Assault
A flanking assault commits a portion of the army’s strength to a hidden attack on the enemy’s rear. While the flanking elements seek a path to the enemy’s weakest point, the main elements must stand their ground alone and unsupported. It is a risky strategy, but one likely to bring about the defeat of even the strongest foe.


Before the start of Game Turn 1, when placing units into Reserve, a player may choose to assign one or more of their units in Reserve to perform a Flanking Assault. All models in a unit assigned to Flanking Assault must have the Outflank special rule, unless embarked on a Transport Vehicle that has the Outflank special rule itself.


Unless stated otherwise by a specific rule, a player may only make a single Flanking Assault. However, this does not limit the player’s ability to undertake any other Reserve action, such as a Deep Strike Assault or other actions described in specific army lists or special rules.


Once all units have been assigned to the Flanking Assault, and all units in both armies have been deployed, but before any Infiltrators deploy or Scout moves are made, place a Flanking marker at any point along the edge of the battlefield (including within the enemy player’s Deployment Zone). This marker represents the intended arrival point of the Flanking Assault.


When rolling for Reserve, roll a single D6 for all of the units assigned to the Flanking Assault rather than rolling separately for each unit. If the roll is successful, and the controlling player chooses to bring them into play, then all of the Flanking Assault units must enter play in that turn and follow the Flanking Assault procedure described below.


Performing a Flanking Assault
Once a Reserve roll for the units assigned to the Flanking Assault has succeeded and the units are to be brought into play, the controlling player must roll a D6. On the roll of a ‘1’, the Flanking Assault is Disordered and the enemy player may move the Flanking marker up to 24&quot; in either direction along the edge of the battlefield. If the roll is a ‘2’ or higher then the player making the Flanking Assault may move the Flanking marker up to 6&quot; in either direction along the edge of the battlefield. Once the Flanking marker’s final position has been determined, the Flanking Assault unit’s controlling player may move the Flanking Assault units onto the battlefield, measuring from the point marked by the Flanking marker, one at a time in an order of their choice. These units may move up to their Movement Characteristic, follow all the normal rules for Movement and may choose to Run. If there is not enough room for all the units taking part in the Flanking Assault to move onto the battlefield, then those that cannot fit must remain in Reserve and move onto the battlefield in their controlling player’s next turn.


Once all Flanking Assault units have moved onto the battlefield, any enemy units that have one or more models within 6&quot; of any unit deployed as part of the Flanking Assault must make an immediate Pinning test. Once all Pinning tests are resolved, any enemy units that are neither Pinned nor Falling Back and are within line of sight may choose to make the Interceptor Reaction targeting any one of the units deployed as part of the Flanking Assault. Units that were unable to deploy in the initial Flanking deployment and were forced to remain in Reserve do not generate Pinning tests when they move onto the battlefield, but may be targeted by Interceptor Reactions.


Once all units from the Flanking Assault have moved onto the battlefield and any Interceptor Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal. Units that have moved onto the battlefield as part of a Flanking Assault may not move or Run again in the current Movement phase, but may Shoot and Assault as normal.</description>

Template weapons can fire Snap Shots at any non-Flyer target.

If a model attacks with a Bomb type weapon, it counts as having already attacked with one weapon in its ensuing Shooting phase. However, any additional weapons it fires that turn can choose a different target to that of the Bomb.


Bombing Runs
To make a Bombing Run, a Flyer must be Zooming. Move the model that is making the Bombing Run, and then nominate one model that it passed over. Place the Blast marker for the Bomb so that the central hole on the marker is over the target model, and roll a Scatter dice. If a Hit is rolled, the attack is on target and the marker is not moved.

Primarchs are not affected by special rules that negatively modify their Characteristics (other than Wounds) and, in addition, Primarchs always resolve Snap Shots at their normal BS.

Any Hits inflicted by a Primarch, as part of either Shooting Attacks or in close combat, are allocated by the Primarch’s controlling player and not the controlling player of the target unit. These Hits should form a separate Wound Pool.
If an army includes any Primarch models, then one of those models must be chosen as the army’s Warlord.</description>

The wider category of Infantry units contains a number of sub-types which may be referenced in other Age of Darkness books. Infantry represent the most basic element of any army and, as such, require no additional rules.

    <rule name="Flyer" id="fc61-c826-2843-bc06" hidden="false">
      <description>The airspace above a battle is just as frantic as on the ground. Fighters and bomber craft hurtle through the skies, duelling with one another and providing fire support for the troops on the ground.


Aerial Support
Flyers must begin the game as Reserve. Special rules that allow an owning player to move one or more of their units out of Reserve after deployment, but before the game begins, cannot be used to move a Flyer out of Reserve, unless they specifically state that Flyers can start the game deployed on the battlefield.


Flyers and Measuring
Flyers have flying bases that suspend them above the battlefield. However, distances are still measured to and from the Flyer’s hull, with the exception of the Vehicle’s weapons, which all work as normal. The base of a Flyer is effectively ignored, except for when:
The Flyer is in close combat, in which case models may move into contact with the Vehicle’s hull, its base or both.
Models are Embarking or Disembarking from the Flyer, in which case the base of the Flyer is used as an Access Point.


Flyers and other Models
Models that physically fit under a Flyer model can move beneath it. Likewise, a Flyer can end its move over such models. However, when moving this way, enemy models must still remain 1&quot; away from the base of the Flyer, and the Flyer cannot end its move with its base within 1&quot; of enemy models.


Zoom
Flyers can usually only make a special kind of move called a Zoom. Some can also Hover. Zooming allows the Flyer to move at extreme speeds, making it very difficult to shoot down, but limits its manoeuvrability.


If a Flyer Zooms, then it may move up to twice its Movement Characteristic. However, a Zooming Flyer can never voluntarily move less than its Movement Characteristic in its own Movement phase. If a Zooming Flyer is forced to move less than its Movement Characteristic in its own Movement phase, it is automatically Wrecked.


To represent its limited manoeuvrability, a Zooming Flyer can only make a single pivot on the spot of up to 90° before it moves. Thereafter, it must move directly forwards in a straight line. In a turn in which a Flyer enters the battlefield from Reserves, it can do so facing any direction you wish, providing that the resulting move will not carry it off the battlefield again.


A Zooming Flyer can move over intervening units and Impassable Terrain exactly as a Skimmer. In addition, a Zooming Flyer does not have to take Dangerous Terrain tests even if it starts or stops over Difficult Terrain, Dangerous Terrain or Impassable Terrain. Finally, unless otherwise stated, models cannot Embark upon, or voluntarily Disembark from, a Zooming Flyer.


Zoom and Ramming
Zooming Flyers cannot Ram, nor can they be Rammed. If a Ramming Vehicle would end up beneath a Zooming Flyer, move the Ramming Vehicle by the shortest distance so that it is 1&quot; away from the base of the Flyer.


Zooming and Shooting
Zooming Flyers can fire up to four of their weapons using their full Ballistic Skill regardless of the distance moved that turn. Zooming Flyers can choose whether or not to use the Skyfire special rule at the start of each Shooting phase. If they do, all weapons they fire that Phase are treated as having the Skyfire special rule.


Shooting Attacks targeting a Zooming Flyer can only be resolved as Snap Shots (unless the model or weapon has the Skyfire special rule). Template and Blast weapons, and any other attacks that do not roll To Hit, cannot hit Zooming Flyers.


Charging Zooming Flyers
Zooming Flyers cannot be Charged.


Repairing Zooming Flyers
Some models have the ability to repair Hull Points, Immobilised or Weapon Destroyed results on Vehicles. Such models can only use such abilities on a Zooming Flyer if that Flyer is a Transport and the model attempting to repair it is Embarked inside it.

Leaving Combat Airspace
It is likely that a Flyer making a Zoom Move will leave the battlefield, either deliberately or by accident. If this happens, the Flyer is said to have left combat airspace – it then enters Reserves. A Flyer that leaves combat airspace must Zoom back on when it returns from Reserves, even if it has the Hover sub-type.


A Flyer cannot leave combat airspace on the same turn that it entered play from Reserves – the owning player must deploy their model in such a way that it will not leave the battlefield on the same turn.


Flyers and Immobilised Results
If a Zooming Flyer suffers an Immobilised result, roll a D6. On a 1 or 2, the Flyer will immediately Crash and Burn. On a 3+, the Immobilised result counts as a Crew Stunned result instead.</description>

    <rule name="Hover" id="3076-6cda-5ce7-a4bf" hidden="false">
      <description>A Flyer that has the Hover sub-type can choose to Hover instead of Zooming. Hovering makes the Flyer slower, but considerably more agile, and in the case of Transports, it allows passengers to Embark or Disembark.


A Flyer with the Hover sub-type must declare whether it is going to Zoom or Hover before it moves, and before any Embarked models Disembark, each Movement phase. This means that if the Flyer arrives from Reserves, you must declare which type of Movement it is using before placing it on the board. If a Flyer is in a Squadron, all Vehicles in the Squadron must choose the same type of Movement. A Flyer in Hover mode cannot switch to Zoom mode if it is Immobilised.</description>

JETBIKES, MODELS AND TERRAIN
Jetbikes can move over all other models and terrain freely. However, if a moving Jetbike begins or ends its move in difficult terrain, it must take a Dangerous Terrain test. Jetbikes cannot end their move over other models or impassable terrain, except that they can end their move on top of impassable terrain if it is actually possible to place the models on top of it.

    <rule name="Artillery" id="ff97-884f-7dbb-5cf8" hidden="false">
      <description>ARTILLERY
If all of the crew models are killed, the guns are immediately removed as well. Sometimes, the player has the choice of adding leaders or additional models to the crew of an Artillery unit. These models are part of the crew in all respects and can operate the guns as normal, even if they are otherwise slightly different from the rest of the crew. Independent Characters who join the unit, however, do not count as crew and cannot operate the guns.
MOVEMENT PHASE
Artillery units need at least one crewman per gun in order for the unit to move. If an Artillery unit does not have at least one crewman per gun, then it may not move.
SHOOTING WITH ARTILLERY
One crewman that is within 2&quot; of a gun in the Shooting phase can fire it. The crewmen firing the gun cannot fire any weapons they are carrying, while the other crew members (and any 
Independent Characters in the unit) are free to fire their side arms, provided the whole unit shoots at the same target. When firing the guns, there must be a line of sight to the target from both the gun model and the crewman firing it (unless they are firing Barrage weapons). Ranges are measured from the barrel on the gun model.
SHOOTING AT ARTILLERY
If shooting at an Artillery unit, the Toughness of the guns is always used whilst at least 
one gun remains. Any wounds caused are still allocated to the closest model first. If an 
Artillery unit chooses to Go to Ground, this does not increase the guns’ cover save – only 
the crew benefit.
ASSAULT PHASE
Artillery units cannot charge as long as they include any gun models. If an Artillery unit is charged, only the crew models can fire Overwatch. After Overwatch has been resolved, move the charging models into base contact with the crew and Artillery gun models as normal. No wounds can be allocated to the guns. All engaged enemies roll To Hit and To Wound against the crew, even if they are only engaged with the guns. Engaged crew models can fight back, but the Artillery guns cannot.
MORALE AND FALL BACK MOVES
For the purposes of Morale checks and other Leadership tests, and for combat resolution, 
always ignore the gun models. Because they need at least one crewman per gun in order to move, if an Artillery unit does not have one crewman per gun when it is forced to Fall Back, any gun models without crewmen are abandoned and immediately removed as casualties. 
The rest of the unit then Falls Back as normal. If an Artillery unit is forced to Fall Back from close combat and the enemy is free to make a Sweeping Advance, then the Artillery unit 
automatically loses the Initiative test and is caught and destroyed by the victor.
ARTILLERY AND LOOK OUT, SIR
A wound cannot be re-allocated onto a gun model from a successful Look Out, Sir 
roll (see page 94).</description>

    <rule name="Jump" id="447d-c2ce-61e5-13b6" hidden="false">
      <description>Jump units can use their jump packs once each turn to move more swiftly in either the Movement phase or the Assault phase – they cannot use their jump packs in both phases in the same turn. If not using its jump pack, a model moves as a normal model of its type. A Jump unit can always choose to move as a normal model of their type if they wish. Note that the entire unit must always use the same form of movement. Units that are described as ‘moving like’ Jump units follow all of the rules for Jump units, and use the same special rules.
SKYBORNE
When using its jump pack (whether moving, charging or Falling Back), a model can move over all other models and terrain freely. However, if the model begins or ends its move in difficult terrain, it must take a Dangerous Terrain test.
Jump models cannot end their move on top of other models and
can only end their move on top of impassable terrain if it is actually possible to place the models on top of it. If they do this, however, they treat the impassable terrain as dangerous terrain.
MOVEMENT PHASE
If a Jump model uses its jump pack (or equivalent) in the Movement phase, it can move up to 12&quot;.
ASSAULT PHASE
If a Jump model uses its jump pack (or equivalent) to charge into 
assault, it can re-roll its charge distance. Furthermore, a model that uses its jump pack to charge gains the Hammer of Wrath special rule for the remainder of the turn.
FALL BACK MOVES
Jump units always use their jump packs when Falling Back, and their Fall Back moves are 3D6&quot;, even if they already used their jump pack to move that turn.
SPECIAL RULES
Jump units have the Bulky (2) and Deep Strike special rules.</description>

SKYBORNE
When using its jet pack (whether moving or making a Thrust move), a model can move over all other models and terrain freely. However, if the model begins or ends its move in difficult terrain, it must take a Dangerous Terrain test.
Jet Pack models cannot end their move on top of other models and can only end their move on top of impassable terrain if it is actually possible to place the models on top of it. If they do this, however, they treat the impassable terrain as dangerous terrain.
THRUST MOVE
A Jet Pack unit that is not locked in combat or charging can move up to 2D6&quot; in the Assault phase, even if they have shot or Run in 
the preceding Shooting phase or arrived by Deep Strike that turn. When Jet Pack units move in the Assault phase and do not charge, they move just as they would when using their jet packs in the Movement phase.

    <rule name="Flying Monstrous Creature" id="9812-f0af-ab5d-d74b" hidden="false">
      <description>Flying Monstrous Creatures are Monstrous Creatures that have a number of additional rules:
DEPLOYMENT
A Flying Monstrous Creature that is deployed at the start of the game starts in Gliding mode. If a Flying Monstrous Creature is kept as 
Reserves then, as soon as it enters play, you must declare whether it is in Swooping or Gliding mode. If a Flying Monstrous Creature arrives via Deep Strike Reserve, it always counts as being in Swooping mode. If a Flying Monstrous Creature is conjured or otherwise summoned during the course of the game, as soon as it enters play, you must declare whether it is in Swooping or Gliding mode.
SPECIAL RULES
In addition to the special rules that all Monstrous Creatures have, Flying Monstrous Creatures also have the Jink and Vector Strike special rules.
FLIGHT MODES
Flying Monstrous Creatures can move using one of two modes: Swooping or Gliding.
Changing Flight Mode
At the start of its move, a Flying Monstrous Creature’s controlling player must declare whether it is Swooping or Gliding until the start of its next turn. If a Flying Monstrous Creature changes flight modes during its turn, it cannot declare a charge during the same turn.
A Gliding Flying Monstrous Creature cannot change flight mode whilst Falling Back.
GLIDING
If a Flying Monstrous Creature is Gliding, it moves, Runs and charges exactly like a Jump Monstrous Creature.
SWOOPING
If a Flying Monstrous Creature is Swooping, it moves exactly like a Jump Monstrous Creature, with the following exceptions:
It must move at least 12&quot; and can move up to 24&quot;.
Due to its limited manoeuvrability, a Flying Monstrous Creature that is Swooping can make a single pivot on the spot of up to 90˚ before it moves. Thereafter it must move directly forwards in a straight line. As many Flying Monstrous Creatures are mounted on circular or oval bases, it is not always clear which way is forward. If in doubt, make sure to use the same point on the base as the ‘front’ for the entire game.
A Flying Monstrous Creature that is Swooping can move over intervening units and impassable terrain exactly as a Jump 
Monstrous Creature. In addition, a Flying Monstrous Creature that is Swooping does not take Dangerous Terrain tests.
Models that physically fit under a Swooping Flying Monstrous Creature can move beneath it. Likewise, a Swooping Flying 
Monstrous Creature can end its move over such models. However, when moving this way, enemy models must still remain 1&quot; away from the base of the Swooping Flying Monstrous Creature, and it cannot end its move with its base within 1&quot; of other enemy models. A Flying Monstrous Creature that elects to Run can move up to 2D6&quot; straight forwards if Swooping.
A Flying Monstrous Creature cannot charge or be charged whilstit is Swooping.
A Swooping Flying Monstrous Creature can never Fall Back.
Hard to Hit
A Swooping Flying Monstrous Creature is a very difficult target for units without specialised weapons. Shots resolved at such a target can only be resolved as Snap Shots unless the model or weapon has the Skyfire special rule (see page 171).
Leaving Combat Airspace
It is likely that, during the course of the battle, a Flying Monstrous Creature will leave the board whilst Swooping. Unlike other units, it can deliberately do this. If this happens, whether deliberately or not, the unit is said to have left combat airspace – it then enters Ongoing Reserves (see page 147). Whilst in Reserve, the unit cannot change its flight mode.
A Flying Monstrous Creature cannot leave combat airspace on the same turn that it entered play from Reserves – the owning player must deploy their model in such a way that it will not leave the board on this turn.
Grounded Tests
If a Flying Monstrous Creature that is Swooping suffers one or more unsaved wounds during any phase, it must take a Grounded test at the end of that phase. To take a Grounded test, roll a D6. On a 3+, the Flying Monstrous Creature maintains control and suffers no additional effect.
If a 1 or 2 is rolled, the beast comes crashing down to the ground – it suffers a single Strength 9 hit with no armour or cover saves allowed, and becomes Grounded. A Grounded Flying Monstrous Creature
is treated as if it is in Gliding mode with immediate effect, and can therefore be charged in the following Assault phase. Furthermore, a Grounded model automatically loses any saving throw granted by the Jink special rule (if it had one) until the start of its next Movement phase and cannot Jink for the rest of the current turn. A Grounded model can revert to Swooping mode again in its next turn.
Note that if a Flying Monstrous Creature is Grounded during the enemy’s turn, it will start its own Movement phase in Gliding mode and so can declare a charge during its turn if it chooses to do so, unless it chooses to change flight modes.
Swooping Flying Monstrous Creatures and Tank Shock
Due to their high altitude and manoeuvrability, a vehicle cannot Tank Shock a Swooping Flying Monstrous Creature (see page 88) – if the vehicle would end up beneath a Swooping Flying Monstrous Creature, move the vehicle by the shortest distance so that it is 1&quot; away from the base of the Flying Monstrous Creature.</description>

    <rule name="Gargantuan Creatures" id="c712-3809-a317-f160" hidden="false">
      <description>Gargantuan Creatures are Monstrous Creatures (see page 67)
that have the additional rules and exceptions given below. Flying Gargantuan Creatures are Flying Monstrous Creatures (see previous page) that have the additional rules and exceptions given below:
MOVEMENT
Gargantuan Creatures can move 12&quot; in the Movement phase unless specified otherwise. Apart from this, they obey the movement
rules for Monstrous Creatures. Flying Gargantuan Creatures follow the movement rules for Flying Monstrous Creatures without
any modification.
SHOOTING
When a Gargantuan Creature or Flying Gargantuan Creature makes a shooting attack, it may fire each of its weapons at a different target if desired. In addition, firing Ordnance weapons has no effect on a
Gargantuan Creature’s or Flying Gargantuan Creature’s ability to fire other weapons. Gargantuan Creatures and Flying Gargantuan Creatures cannot fire Overwatch.
STOMP
Gargantuan Creatures and Gliding Flying Gargantuan Creatures may make Stomp attacks in the same manner as Super-heavy 
Walkers (see page 92).
UNSTOPPABLE
Any attack that normally inflicts Instant Death or says that the target model is removed from play inflicts D3 wounds on a Gargantuan Creature or Flying Gargantuan Creature instead. In addition, attacks with the Sniper special rule only cause a wound on a roll of a 6. Attacks with the Poisoned special rule only cause a wound on a roll of a 6 (unless the attacker’s Strength would cause a wound on a lower result).
SPECIAL RULES
Gargantuan Creatures and Flying Gargantuan Creatures have the following special rules: Fear, Fearless, Feel No Pain, Hammer of Wrath, Move Through Cover, Relentless, Smash, Strikedown, Vector Strike (Flying Gargantuan Creatures only).</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Vehicle" id="a32a-5850-0dba-eac8" hidden="false">
      <description>As vehicle models do not usually have bases, the normal rule of measuring distances to or from a base cannot be used. Instead, measure to and from their hull, ignoring gun barrels, dozer blades, banners and other decorative elements.
There is, however, the notable exception of a vehicle’s weaponry. When firing a vehicle’s weapons, ranges are measured from the muzzle of the firing weapon, whilst line of sight is determined from the weapon’s mounting point and along its barrel, as will be explained later in this section.
VEHICLES IN THE MOVEMENT PHASE
The distance a vehicle moves dictates how accurately it can fire its weapons, as described later.
Stationary. A vehicle that remains stationary will be able to bring its full firepower to bear on the enemy.


Combat Speed. A vehicle that travels up to 6&quot; is said to be moving at Combat Speed. This represents the vehicle advancing slowly to keep firing, albeit with reduced firepower.


Cruising Speed. A vehicle that travels more than 6&quot; and up to 12&quot; is said to be moving at Cruising Speed. This represents the vehicle diverting power to keep it moving as fast as possible, making all of its firepower wildly inaccurate. Vehicles can turn any number of times as they move, just like any other model.

Moving Flat Out
A vehicle can elect to move Flat Out instead of firing in the Shooting phase, immediately moving up to 6&quot;; this move triggers Dangerous Terrain tests as normal. A Tank cannot move Flat Out in the same turn that it performs a Tank Shock.

Vehicles turn by pivoting on the spot about their centre-point, rather than wheeling round. Pivoting on the spot alone does not count as moving, so a vehicle that only pivots in
the Movement phase counts as Stationary (however, Immobilised vehicles cannot even pivot on the spot). Pivoting is always done from the centre of a vehicle to prevent it from accidentally moving further than intended or allowed. Just like other units, vehicles cannot move over friendly models. Difficult and Dangerous Terrain Vehicles moving through broken terrain are not slowed like other units, but still risk becoming stuck or damaged. Vehicles are not slowed down by difficult terrain. However, they treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain instead. A vehicle that fails a Dangerous Terrain test immediately loses one Hull point and suffers an Immobilised result from the Vehicle Damage table (see page 74).
VEHICLES IN THE PSYCHIC PHASE
Vehicles with the Psychic Pilot special rule (see page 170) manifest their psychic powers during the Psychic phase, as normal.
VEHICLES IN THE SHOOTING PHASE
When a vehicle fires, it uses its own Ballistic Skill characteristic and shoots like any other unit. All its weapons must fire at a  single target unit. 
Moving and Shooting with Vehicles
All vehicles have the Relentless special rule, but the number and accuracy of the weapons a vehicle can fire in the Shooting phase depends on how fast it moved in that turn’s Movement phase:
A vehicle that remained Stationary can fire all of its weapons. Note that pivoting on the spot does not count as moving.
A vehicle that moved at Combat Speed may fire a single weapon using its Ballistic Skill. Thevehicle can also fire Snap Shots
with any other weapons.
A vehicle that moved at Cruising Speed can only make Snap Shots, as above.
Vehicles and Ordnance Weapons
Unlike other units, vehicles can move and fire with Ordnance weapons. However, a vehicle that fires an Ordnance weapon can only make Snap Shots with its other weapons that turn.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Transport" id="ebe2-6e53-8dee-4fdc" hidden="false">
      <description>Transports have several additional characteristics: Transport Capacity, Fire Points and Access Points.
TRANSPORT CAPACITY
Each Transport vehicle has a maximum passenger capacity that
can never be exceeded. A Transport can carry a single Infantry unit and/or any number of Independent Characters (as long as they are also Infantry), up to a total number of models equal to the vehicle’s Transport Capacity. The entire unit must be embarked on the Transport if any part of it is – a unit cannot be partially embarked or be spread across multiple Transports.
Only Infantry models can embark upon Transports (this does
not include Jump or Jet Pack Infantry), unless specifically stated otherwise.


Unshakable Nerve
Units embarked upon transports have the Fearless special rule while they are embarked.


Disembarking
A unit that begins its Movement phase embarked upon a vehicle can disembark either before or after the vehicle has moved 
(including pivoting on the spot, etc) so long as the vehicle has not moved more than 6&quot;.
If the vehicle had not moved before the unit disembarked, the
vehicle can then move normally. If the vehicle had already moved 
before the unit disembarked, the vehicle cannot move further that turn (including pivoting on the spot, moving Flat Out, Running or charging). In addition, a vehicle cannot Tank Shock or Ram on a turn that a unit disembarks from it.
Placing Disembarked Models
When a unit disembarks, place the models one at a time, using the following method: place the first model in base contact with one of the vehicle’s Access Points (including its flying base, if it has one). A disembarking model’s base cannot be placed within 1&quot; of an enemy model or within impassable terrain.The model can then make a normal move – Difficult Terrain tests and Dangerous Terrain tests should be taken as normal, but it must end its move wholly within 6&quot; of the Access Point it disembarked from. Repeat this process for each model in the unit. At the end of the unit’s move, all models must be in unit coherency.
Disembarkation Restrictions
After disembarking, models can manifest their psychic powers and either shoot or Run in their subsequent Shooting phase, counting as having moved that turn, but they cannot declare a charge in their subsequent Assault phase. If a unit disembarks from a destroyed vehicle during the enemy turn, it cannot charge in the Assault phase of its own turn unless the destroyed vehicle had the Assault Vehicle special rule (see page 157).
Emergency Disembarkation
If any models cannot disembark, because of enemies or because they would end up in impassable terrain, the unit can perform an emergency disembarkation. In this case, a model can be placed anywhere in contact with the vehicle’s hull and then can move as for a normal disembarkation. The unit cannot then perform any voluntary actions for the rest of the turn. If even this disembarkation is impossible, because it is impossible to place one or more models, then the unit can’t disembark.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Chariot" id="faa6-38b7-f49e-afb2" hidden="false">
      <description>A Chariot is an unusual unit with a dual profile – a non-vehicle profile for the rider of the Chariot, and a vehicle profile for the Chariot itself. However, a Chariot is always treated as a single model. For the purposes of characteristics tests, always use the rider’s profile. Furthermore, any characteristics modifiers that affect a Chariot model apply to both rider and Chariot.
CHARACTERS RIDING CHARIOTS
A character mounted on a Chariot is referred to as the rider. A rider cannot disembark from their Chariot, nor can they be targeted separately from their Chariot. If either the rider is reduced to 0 Wounds or their Chariot is destroyed, then the entire model is removed from play as a casualty. If the rider has a special rule that returns it to play after it has been removed as a casualty, that model’s Chariot is also returned to play with a single Hull point.
MOVING CHARIOTS
Chariots move normally for a vehicle of their type.
SHOOTING WITH CHARIOTS
When determining the required To Hit roll for any weapons fired by a Chariot model, use the Ballistic Skill on the Chariot’s profile for any weapons mounted on the Chariot itself, and the Ballistic Skill on the rider’s profile for any weapons wielded by the rider. In addition to the Chariot’s weapons shooting, the rider can shoot any shooting weapon that they themselves are equipped with, counting as stationary even if the Chariot moved in the previous Movement phase – the Chariot and rider must target the same unit though.</description>

    <rule name="Open-Topped" id="6f94-a8c3-4028-c3b4" hidden="false">
      <description>VEHICLE DAMAGE TABLE
A lack of armour leaves vital parts of these vehicles vulnerable. If 
a vehicle is Open-topped, add 1 to any rolls made on the Vehicle Damage table (this is cumulative with other modifiers).
OPEN-TOPPED TRANSPORTS
Open-topped vehicles do not have specific Access Points. Instead, the entire vehicle is considered to be an Access Point (regardless of any base it may have).
Passengers Shooting from Open-topped Transports
Open-topped Transports do not have specific Fire Points. Instead, all passengers in an Open-topped Transport can fire, measuring range and line of sight from any point on the hull of the vehicle.
Passengers Charging from Open-topped Transports
Acting as an ideal attack platform, all Open-topped Transports have the Assault Vehicle special rule (see page 157).</description>

      <description>MOVING HEAVY VEHICLES
Heavy vehicles can never move faster than Combat Speed and can never move Flat Out.
SHOOTING WITH HEAVY VEHICLES
For the purposes of determining which weapons a Heavy vehicle can fire (and at what Ballistic Skill), Heavy vehicles are always treated as having remained Stationary.</description>

SHOOTING WITH FAST VEHICLES
Fast vehicles that moved at Combat Speed in the preceding 
Movement phase can fire all of their weapons, just like other types of vehicles that have remained Stationary. Fast vehicles that moved at Cruising Speed can fire up to two weapons using their full Ballistic Skill – other weapons can only make Snap Shots.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Skimmer" id="dcd9-220c-8271-4d18" hidden="false">
      <description>SKIMMERS AND MEASURING
Unlike most other vehicles, Skimmers have flying bases under their hull. However, distances are still measured to and from the Skimmer’s hull, with the exceptions of the vehicle’s weapons and Fire Points, which all work as normal. The base of a skimmer is effectively 
ignored, except for when the Skimmer is being charged or Rammed, in which case, models may move into contact with the vehicle’s hull, its base or both.
MOVING SKIMMERS
Skimmers can move over friendly and enemy models, but they cannot end their move on top of either.
Skimmers can move over all terrain, ignoring all penalties for 
Difficult Terrain and Dangerous Terrain tests. However, if a moving Skimmer starts or ends its move in difficult terrain or dangerous terrain, it must take a Dangerous Terrain test. A Skimmer can even end its move over impassable terrain if it is possible to actually place the model on top of it, but if it does so it must take a Dangerous Terrain test. If a Skimmer is forced to end its move over friendly or enemy models, move the Skimmer the minimum distance so that no models are left underneath it.
FAST SKIMMERS
If a vehicle is both Fast (see previous page) and a Skimmer, it can move up to 18&quot; when moving Flat Out.
SKIMMERS AND DAMAGE RESULTS
If a Skimmer is Immobilised or Wrecked, its base is removed, if possible. If this is not possible (the base might have been glued in place, for example), then leave the base in place. Note that it is not otherwise permitted to remove the flying base, as Skimmers cannot land in battle conditions.
SPECIAL RULES
Skimmers that are not also Heavy vehicles or are Immobilised have the Jink special rule.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Tank" id="74cc-b221-bcb5-e818" hidden="false">
      <description>When moving a vehicle with the Tank type, the player can declare that it is going to attempt to Tank Shock or Ram instead of 
moving normally.
TANK SHOCK
To perform a Tank Shock, first turn the vehicle on the spot to face the direction you intend to move it in, and, after pre-measuring, declare how many inches the vehicle is going to move, up to its maximum speed. Note that, because pivoting on the spot does not count as moving, this is not enough for a Tank Shock. Once the Tank has been ‘aimed’ and the intended distance declared, move the Tank straight forwards until it comes into contact with an enemy unit or it reaches the distance declared – no other changes of direction are allowed in a Tank Shock. A Tank Shock is an exception to the rule that enemy models cannot be moved through. Remember, though, that friendly models still cannot be moved through, so the Tank’s movement will be stopped if any friendly models are in the way. A Tank Shock cannot be attempted against enemies that are locked in combat.
If an enemy unit other than another vehicle is reached, that enemy unit must take a Morale check and immediately Fall Back if it fails. If the test is passed, the unit simply lets the tank pass through, as if it was not there. Regardless of the result of the test, the Tank keeps moving straight on, possibly Tank Shocking more enemy units until it reaches its final position. If the Tank would move into contact with a friendly model, enemy vehicle, impassable terrain or a board edge, it immediately stops moving 1&quot; away.
If some enemy models in the enemy unit would end up underneath the vehicle when it reaches its final position (it makes no difference whether the unit is Falling Back or not), these models must be moved out of the way by the shortest distance, leaving at least 1&quot; between them and the vehicle whilst maintaining unit coherency and staying on the tabletop. Any models that cannot manage this are crushed and removed from play as casualties with no saves allowed.

Units already Falling Back
If a unit that is Falling Back is Tank Shocked, the unit automatically fails its Morale check. This also applies if a unit Falls Back from a Tank Shock and the Tank’s remaining move brings it into contact with them a second time.


Tank Shock from Reserve
A Tank that moves onto the battlefield from Reserve may attempt a Tank Shock. This must be declared before the Tank moves
onto the board.


Tank Shock Restrictions
A vehicle that has performed a Tank Shock cannot move Flat Out later in the turn. Units cannot embark onto or disembark from a Transport vehicle in a turn in which it has already performed a Tank Shock. Likewise, a Transport vehicle from which a unit has embarked or disembarked that phase cannot perform a Tank Shock later in the turn. A Flyer cannot perform a Tank Shock – even if it is also a Tank.

Death or Glory
If a unit that has been attacked by Tank Shock passes its Morale check, one of its models in the vehicle’s path can stand and attempt to destroy it rather than move out of the way. The nominated model makes a single attack against the oncoming Tank. Even if the weapon used is Assault 3, for example, or the model is normally allowed more than one attack, only one attack is ever resolved in this case. The attack can either be a shot from a weapon carried by the model, or a single close combat attack using any weapon carried, including grenades. Whatever form it takes, the attack hits automatically. Resolve the hit against the vehicle’s Front armour (even if using a close combat attack), and immediately apply any damage results. Cover saves cannot be taken against a Death or Glory attack. If the model successfully manages to wreck the vehicle, or inflict a Crew Stunned, Immobilised or Explodes! result, the vehicle halts 1&quot; away from the model. If the attack fails to stop the vehicle, then the Tank Shock continues as normal, except that the model is crushed by the oncoming vehicle and is immediately removed as a casualty. Artillery units may attempt a Death or Glory attack with either a crewman (as normal) or a gun model. If a gun model does this and fails to stop the tank, both the gun and one crewman are removed.


RAMMING
Ramming is a special type of Tank Shock and is executed in the same way. Any vehicle that can Tank Shock can also Ram. The vehicle attempting a Ram attack and any embarked troops, may only fire Snap Shots in that turn’s Shooting phase. Units other than vehicles in the path of a Ramming Tank are Tank Shocked as normal, but if the Ramming Tank comes into contact with an enemy vehicle or building, resolve the collision as follows:
Each vehicle immediately suffers a hit against the armour facing where the other vehicle has impacted (so the Ramming vehicle always uses its Front armour). The Strength of the hits will often be different for different vehicles, and is calculated as follows for each vehicle:
Armour: Halve the Armour Value (rounding up) on the facing that makes impact.
Mass: If the vehicle has the Tank type, add 1.
Excessive mass: If the vehicle has the Heavy or Super-heavy type, or is a building, add 2.


Both players roll for armour penetration against their opponent’s vehicle and any results are immediately applied. If the vehicle that is Rammed is not removed, the Rammer halts. However, if the Rammed vehicle is removed because it suffers an 
Explodes! damage result, the Rammer continues its move until it reaches the declared distance, moves to within 1&quot; of impassable 
terrain or friendly troops (at which point it stops immediately) or contacts another enemy unit (which it will Tank Shock or Ram again)
Ramming Restrictions
A vehicle making a Ram manoeuvre is subject to the same restrictions as a Tank Shock.</description>

    <rule name="Super-Heavy" id="5302-5f46-d557-4b58" hidden="false">
      <description>Super-heavy vehicles are vehicles that have the additional rules and exceptions given below.
MOVEMENT
Regardless of their type, Super-heavy vehicles cannot use the Jink special rule.
SHOOTING
When a Super-heavy vehicle makes a shooting attack, it is always treated as if it had remained stationary in the Movement phase (even if it actually moved), and it may fire each of its weapons at different targets if desired. In addition, firing Ordnance weapons has no effect on a Super-heavy vehicle’s ability to fire other weapons.
VEHICLE DAMAGE
Super-heavy vehicles have armour plating and internal supports far superior to those of 
regular vehicles. This translates into a greater number of Hull points, which makes them more difficult to destroy. In addition, each time a Super-heavy vehicle suffers an Explodes! result on the Vehicle Damage table, instead of suffering the effects listed, it loses D3 additional Hull points as well as the Hull point it loses for the penetrating hit. Furthermore, a Super-heavy is so large and has so many crew members that the effects of Crew Shaken, Crew Stunned, Immobilised or Weapon Destroyed results are ignored. 
However, Super-heavy vehicles are still subject to losing Hull points from glancing hits and penetrating hits as usual, just not the extra damage effects from the Vehicle Damage table.
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE
Immediately after a Super-heavy vehicle loses its last Hull point, it suffers Catastrophic 
Damage and explodes. Instead of the usual procedure for exploding vehicles, remove the model and centre the Apocalyptic Mega-blast marker (see page 158) over the location the destroyed model occupied; then roll for scatter. Resolve the hits as described on page 158. Roll once on the Catastrophic Damage table on page 90 to see what Strength and AP values apply to all hits caused by the explosion.

SPECIAL RULES
Super-heavy vehicles have the following special rules:
Fear, Move Through Cover, Invincible Behemoth, Thunderblitz
In addition, any attacks or special abilities which permanently lower the Armour Values of a target vehicle do not affect a Super-heavy vehicle. Note that attacks or abilities that count the Armour Value as being lower, but do not actually change it, work normally.


SUPER-HEAVY TRANSPORTS
If a Super-heavy vehicle has a Transport Capacity, then it may transport any number of Infantry units (plus any characters that have joined the units), so long as the number of models in the transported units do not exceed the vehicle’s Transport Capacity. Each unit embarked within a Super-heavy vehicle that suffers Catastrophic Damage takes a number of Strength 10 AP 2 hits equal to the number of models in that unit. These wounds are Randomly Allocated. Surviving passengers are placed where the vehicle used to be; any models that cannot be placed are removed as casualties. The units then take Pinning tests.


SUPER-HEAVY FLYER
Super-heavy Flyers are Flyers (see page 80) that have the additional rules and exceptions as follows:
SUPER-HEAVY
Super-heavy Flyers are Super-heavy vehicles and use the Super-heavy vehicle rules for Shooting, Vehicle Damage, Catastrophic Damage and Transports (see page 90).
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE
Do not use the Crash and Burn! rules for Super-heavy Flyers. Instead, a Super-heavy Flyer suffers Catastrophic Damage when it loses its
last Hull point. Resolve the Catastrophic Damage on the Super-heavy Flyer and any units it is transporting in exactly the same manner as for a Super-heavy vehicle (see page 90).
SPECIAL RULES
All Super-heavy Flyers have the following special rules:
Fear, Invincible Behemoth (see page 90).</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Invincible Behemoth" id="858f-6369-20a7-e8a2" hidden="false">
      <description>A Super-heavy vehicle is so large and strongly built that weapons which degrade the armour of smaller vehicles will not affect it. Due to this, any attack which says that the target model is destroyed, wrecked, Explodes! or is otherwise removed from play inflicts D3 Hull points of damage on a Super-heavy vehicle instead.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Thunderblitz" id="bb0a-abb0-5a55-fd78" hidden="false">
      <description>THUNDERBLITZ
Super-heavy vehicles may Tank Shock or Ram. When they do so, roll once on the Thunderblitz table on page 91 immediately before taking the Morale check for the unit being Tank Shocked, or immediately before rolling for armour penetration when  performing a Ram.
Do not roll on the Thunderblitz table when Tank Shocking a Gargantuan Creature
or Flying Gargantuan Creature, or when Ramming a Super-heavy vehicle or Superheavy Walker. Instead, simply carry out
the Tank Shock or Ram as described on page 88 or page 89.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Character" id="febd-e9cc-2253-20b3" hidden="false">
      <description>LOOK OUT, SIR AND SHOOTING
When a wound is allocated to one of your non-vehicle characters, and there is another model from the same unit within 6&quot;, they are allowed a Look Out, Sir attempt. This represents the character falling back into the unit or being pushed aside by an ally. If no model is in range, then you cannot make a Look Our, Sir attempt.
To make a Look Out, Sir attempt, roll a D6.
On a roll of 3 or less, the Look Out, Sir attempt fails.
On a roll of 4+, the Look Out, Sir attempt is successful. 


Determine which model in the unit is closest to the character, and allocate the wound to that model instead. This can
even be a model that is out of range or line of sight of the shooting attack.If the unit only consists of characters, a Look Out, Sir attempt can still be made, with the closest character within 6&quot; taking the place of the original target if the roll is passed. Only one Look Out, Sir attempt can be made per wound allocated – once the wound has been transferred (or not), no further attempts to reallocate it can be made.


LOOK OUT, SIR AND ASSAULTS
As with shooting attacks, if a non-vehicle character has a wound allocated to them, and there is another model from the same unit within 6&quot;, that model may make a Look Out, Sir attempt. This works exactly the same way as for shooting attacks. However,
a character who is fighting in a challenge (see opposite) cannot attempt to make a Look Out, Sir attempt.</description>

    <rule name="Acute Senses" id="3db5-c897-7813-709a" hidden="false">
      <description>If a unit contains at least one model with this special rule, and that unit arrives on a random table edge (due to Outflank or other special rules), then you can re-roll to see which table edge they will arrive from.</description>

    <rule name="Agile" id="5712-357a-18ad-0dfd" hidden="false">

    <rule name="Automated Artillery" id="5f03-7fab-2f2e-1d21" hidden="false">
      <description>Unlike standard Artillery, Automated Artillery does not require crew in order to function. It is not removed from play due to a lack of
crew and each gun must be destroyed normally before it is removed. Automated Artillery cannot move and cannot charge. If assaulted, they do not Pile In and cannot be locked in combat. Their attackers will hit automatically, but must roll To Wound normally. If a unit of Automated Artillery loses an assault, nothing happens. There are no Sweeping Advances, no Pile Ins and no Consolidation moves. The Automated Artillery remains in place and may fire normally in future turns. If the Automated Artillery wins an assault, the enemy must take a Morale check as normal, although the Artillery cannot Consolidate or make a Sweeping Advance.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Barrage" id="6729-a069-dfde-b0e5" hidden="false">
      <description>All Barrage weapons use Blast markers and consequently use the rules for Blast weapons, as indicated by their profile, with the following exceptions:
Barrage weapons can fire indirectly. This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their minimum range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit! is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker always scatters a full 2D6&quot;. If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its minimum range.


To determine whether a unit wounded by a Barrage weapon is allowed a cover save, and when determining wound  allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the Blast marker, instead of from the firing model. Hits against vehicles are always resolved against their Side armour


Multiple Barrages
If a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:
The Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the Blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as 
described earlier.
Once the first marker is placed, roll a Scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram on page 160).
If a Hit! is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker).


Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of hits and roll To Wound for these hits. To determine wound allocation and cover saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first Blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Psyker" id="efe6-c91d-9e37-1c3a" hidden="false">
      <description>Common to all forms of psychic ability is the possibility of the Warp’s power rebelling and wreaking havoc on the Psyker and their allies. This is represented by the Perils of the Warp special rule. Most Psychic Powers and Weapons dictate under what conditions a Psyker must suffer Perils of the Warp, but in most cases this will be as the result of a failed Leadership test while using a Psychic Power or attack.


Whenever a Psyker or other model/unit suffers Perils of the Warp, apply the rule below:


Perils of the Warp: When a model or unit suffers Perils of the Warp, it receives D3 Wounds against which only Invulnerable Saves may be taken (no Damage Mitigation rolls may be made to negate these Wounds). These Wounds may be allocated to any model in the unit, including models without the Psyker Sub-type, in the same manner as those received during a Shooting Attack. If the Psyker is a Vehicle, it suffers D3 Hull Points of damage against which only Invulnerable Saves may be taken.


These Hull Points of damage may be allocated to other Vehicle models in the same Squadron, in the same manner as a Shooting Attack.</description>

    <rule name="Co-Axial Weapon" id="9978-0379-a2a0-63f5" hidden="false">
      <description>A weapon with the Co-axial special rule will specify another weapon mounted on the same vehicle.

    <rule name="Graviton Pulse" id="75da-4856-b7ae-22e6" hidden="false">

After a Graviton Pulse weapon has been fired, leave the Blast marker in place. This area now counts as both difficult terrain and dangerous terrain for the next turn thanks to the gravity flux.</description>

      <description>After both sides have deployed (including Infiltrators), but before the first player begins their first turn, a unit containing at least one model with this special rule can choose to redeploy. If the unit is Infantry, Artillery, a Walker or a Monstrous Creature, each model can redeploy anywhere entirely within 6&quot; of its current position.
If it is any other unit type, each model can instead redeploy 
anywhere entirely within 12&quot; of its current position. During this 
redeployment, Scouts can move outside the owning player’s 
deployment zone, but must remain more than 12&quot; away from any enemy unit. A unit that makes a Scout redeployment cannot charge in the first game turn. A unit cannot embark or disembark as part of a Scout redeployment.


If both sides have Scouts, roll-off; the winner decides who redeploys first. Then alternate redeploying Scout units.

If a unit with this special rule is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, it confers the Scout special rule to the Transport (though a disembarkation cannot be performed as part of the redeployment). Note that a Transport with this special rule does not lose it if a unit without this special rule is embarked upon it. Having Scout also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Scouts that are kept as Reserves (see page 147).


Outflank
During deployment, players can declare that any unit that contains at least one model with this special rule is attempting to Outflank the enemy. When this unit arrives from Reserves, but not Ongoing Reserve, the controlling player rolls a D6. On a 1-2, the unit comes in from the table edge to the left of their controlling player’s own table edge. On a 3-4, they come on from the right. On a 5-6, the player can choose left or right. Models move onto the table as described for other Reserves. 
If a unit with Scouts is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, they may Outflank along with their Transport.
Infiltrate and Scout
If a unit has both the Infiltrate and Scout special rule, that unit can deploy as per the Infiltrate special rule and then redeploy as per the Scout special rule.</description>

All models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type are immune to the effects of the Fear (X) special rule, cannot be Pinned, and a unit that includes one or more models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type automatically passes Pinning and Regroup tests and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless special rule. When a unit that includes one or more models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type fails a Morale check, the unit does not Fall Back as per the standard rules, but instead suffers D3 automatic Wounds with no Saves of any kind allowed which must be allocated to a model with the Daemon Primarch or Daemon Unit Type or the Corrupted Unit Sub-type.
Any Hits inflicted by a model with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type, as part of either Shooting Attacks or in close combat, are allocated by that model’s controlling player and not the controlling player of the target unit. These Hits should form a separate Wound Pool.
If an army includes any models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type, then one of those models must be chosen as the army’s Warlord. • For the purposes of any special rule that affects or has additional effects that target models with the Daemon or Primarch Unit Type, a model with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type is considered to have the Daemon and Primarch Unit Types</description>

      <characteristics>
        <characteristic name="Description" typeId="a1cc-ea5e-6a1d-d78e">At the start of the controlling player’s Movement phase, or when deployed as part of a Ruinstorm Incursion, a model with Daemonic Wings may set its Movement Characteristic to a value of 14 for the duration of the controlling player’s turn (sometimes referred to as ‘activating’ this special rule). This allows a model with Daemonic Wings to move up to 14&quot;, regardless of the Movement Characteristic shown on their profile and gain any other benefits of a Movement Characteristic of 14 (including the bonus to Charge distance). In addition, models with Daemonic Wings that have been activated ignore terrain while Moving and Charging, but must take Dangerous Terrain tests as normal when beginning or ending their Movement in Dangerous Terrain. A model with Daemonic Wings that have been activated treats all Difficult Terrain as Dangerous Terrain and may move over both friendly and enemy models or units without penalty – but must end its Movement at least 1&quot; away from any model from another unit.

A model with Daemonic Wings may still Run if it would normally be able to Run (this does not allow units that include any models with the Heavy Sub-type to Run). When making a Run move for a model with activated Daemonic Wings, add the Initiative Characteristic of the model to 14 to determine how far it may move – the model ignores terrain and models from other units while making a Run move with Daemonic Wings as previously noted, but may not make Shooting Attacks or declare a Charge in the same turn in which it has Run as per the normal rules for Running.
Any model with a jump pack also gains the Bulky (2), Hammer of Wrath (1) and Deep Strike special rules – if it already has the Bulky (2) special rule, it gains the Bulky (3) special rule instead. Any models with Daemonic Wings deployed as part of a Ruinstorm Incursion may activate their Daemonic Wings in the Movement Phase of the turn in which they enter play.</characteristic>

Once triggered, the model with smoke launchers counts as being more than 25% obscured, regardless of terrain, until the start of the controlling player’s next turn and gains a 6+ Cover Save. A model whose smoke launchers have been triggered may not make any Shooting Attacks, except as part of a Reaction, in the same turn. Smoke launchers may only be used once per battle, and once triggered may not be further used – in addition, they do not count as a weapon and may not be targeted by Weapon Destroyed results on the Vehicle Damage table.</characteristic>

Jetbikes can move over all other models and terrain freely. However, if a moving Jetbike begins or ends its move in difficult terrain, it must take a Dangerous Terrain test. Jetbikes cannot end their move over other models or impassable terrain, except that they can end their move on top of impassable terrain if it is actually possible to place the models on top of it. If they do so, they treat the impassable terrain as dangerous terrain.</characteristic>
